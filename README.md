# MLspace

Documenting my journey learning languages in the ML (Meta Language) family, in particular OCaml. Presently I am working through the [OCaml course on Exercism](https://exercism.org/tracks/ocaml/exercises/) as well as preparing for Advent of Code.

The [OCaml API documentation (currently on Version 5.1) can be found here](https://v2.ocaml.org/releases/5.1/api/index.html).
