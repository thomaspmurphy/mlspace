# MLspace

Documenting my journey learning languages in the [ML (Meta Language)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ML_(programming_language)) family, in particular the OCaml dialect. Presently I am working through the [OCaml course on Exercism](https://exercism.org/tracks/ocaml/exercises/) as well as preparing for Advent of Code.

The [OCaml API documentation (currently on Version 5.1) can be found here](https://v2.ocaml.org/releases/5.1/api/index.html).

## Books
- The Definition of Standard ML, (see [my notes on this so far](notes_books/definition-of-standard-ml.md)). An authorised PDF is available [here](https://smlfamily.github.io/sml97-defn.pdf). The grammar from Appendix A can be found online [here](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~rossberg/sml.html).
